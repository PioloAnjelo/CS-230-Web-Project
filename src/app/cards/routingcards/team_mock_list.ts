        name: "Amir Rao",
        text1: "Amir grew up in the very place in which Supergiant Games was originally headquartered - the same home in which he took up hosting pen-and-paper role-playing sessions at the tender age of 10. To this day, he still DMs to the same group, which includes our very own Darren Korb! Contrary to the impression this must give, he did move out of his parents' house for a while. After majoring in English at Columbia University, he joined Electronic Arts to work on the Command & Conquer franchise, where he was responsible for design on Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars and Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3. Along with his colleague Gavin, he left the studio in 2009 to form Supergiant Games in his ongoing quest to give back to gaming what gaming's given him. At Supergiant, Amir oversees production of our games, designs and tunes much of the gameplay in them, and takes point on many other day-to-day operations. However, his greatest accomplishment may or may not be the following Diablo II-inspired music video.",

        text1: "Gavin was born in the same month the Nintendo Entertainment System shipped to North America, and it wasn't long before he wrenched that controller away from older kids’ hands. And he never let go. Like a modern-day boy-raised-by-wolves (OK maybe not), Gavin was fostered by the likes of Mario, Link, Samus, Mega Man, and other iconic heroes from the golden age of games. Gavin got his start in the game industry at the wee age of 15, when he joined Westwood Studios as a tester on Command & Conquer: Yuri’s Revenge, and subsequently worked on every title from that team including C&C Generals and Zero Hour, The Battle for Middle-earth and its sequel, C&C 3, and Red Alert 3. During this tenure, Gavin soon rose from the ranks of QA due to his proficiency as an engineer and designer, as well as his surpassing skill as a player – he was 1v1 ladder champion on both Generals and C&C 3. At Supergiant, Gavin lends his mad APM to building our engine and tools, and all aspects of our games, from systems to characters and everything in between.",

        name: "Darren Korb",
        text1: "A childhood friend of Amir's, Darren likewise hails from the exciting and completely flat city of San Jose, CA, which afforded him with the peace and solitude in which to follow his muse and hone his musical craft from a young age (and play a lot of D&D). Darren is a composer and musician who’s worked in film and television, in addition to authoring songs for the Rock Band network – something that combines his lifelong love of music with his lifelong love of games. It tells you something about this guy that in 2010 he reigned as the Rock Band 2 national champion. Seriously, you should see the photos. At Supergiant Games, Darren is a one-man band who provides all of our outstanding audio, from creating sound effects to recording all the voiceover that brings our games to life, and, of course, to crafting the award-winning and unforgettable musical scores so vital to the atmosphere. He also seems to know more good places to eat than anyone who has ever lived.",

        text1: "Jen hails from beautiful, sunny Seattle, which was so sunny, in fact, that she was forced inside from out of the oppressive heat and light and into cooler places such as Dracula’s castle and Shadow Moses Island. Like the rest of the team at Supergiant, she’s been playing games practically since she can remember, even as she honed her artistic abilities in media ranging from comics to tabletop games to massively multiplayer online games. We were instantly impressed with her incredible talent for creating vivid characters and places, and she somehow managed as the only artist on our team throughout development of our first game, Bastion. As our fearless art director, Jen now operates alongside an S-tier squad of elite artists who together form a sort of Art Voltron. Among them, Jen continues to create the lush, imaginative hand-painted artwork that defines the distinctive look of our gameworlds and all their colorful denizens.",

        text1: "After his parents whisked him away from the land of tolerance and freedom that was the Soviet Union, Greg must have subconsciously decided to take full advantage of the land of opportunity here in the United States by spending a disproportionate amount of time playing video games as a kid -- just about anything he could get his hands on, from quarter-munching arcade shoot-’em-ups, to sprawling computer role-playing games. He started writing about games professionally in high school, and wound up working at the gaming web site GameSpot for more than 10 years, during which time he rose from intern all the way to editor-in-chief (earning degrees in English literature and business administration on the side). In spite of this long stretch in the gaming press, Greg never lost sight of his childhood dream of making games. He finally got his first shot in 2007 when he joined EA LA, where he met Amir Rao and Gavin Simon while working on Command & Conquer 3 and Red Alert 3. They became fast friends, and reunited at Supergiant, where Greg is responsible for conjuring up the gameworlds, characters, and stories that define our games.",
